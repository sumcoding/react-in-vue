# react in vue
A more in depth example that does not require react to be a dependency of the vue host (but its also not working as expected)

Also has a shared store state using xoid.

### Start Project
`pnpm install`
`pnpm serve` to serve all
`http://localhost:7000/` is the vue host


### Apps and Packages

- `apps`: remotes and host to test with
- `packages/config`: shared `eslint`, `ts` and `vite` configurations


Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
